/**
 * Conceptually similar to `SingleLiveEvent`, [EventBuffer] delivers events across the
 * boundary between View and ViewModel. Unlike `SingleLiveEvent`, however, [EventBuffer]
 * guarantees that each event is consumed once and only once.
 *
 * The [EventBuffer] inherits a buffer size of 64 items from [Channel]. If the buffer
 * grows beyond 64 unprocessed events, any further calls to [MutableEventBuffer.send]
 * will suspend.
 *
 * Only a single subscriber is allowed to [collect] the [EventBuffer] at a time. Any
 * subsequent calls to [collect] while the previous collector is still active will
 * yield an [IllegalStateException]. If you need to deliver a single event to multiple
 * observers, consider creating an [EventBuffer] for each observer separately.
